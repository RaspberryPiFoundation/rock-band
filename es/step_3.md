## Sprites

Before you can start coding, you'll need to add in a 'thing' to code. In Scratch, these 'things' are called **sprites**.

+ First, open up the Scratch editor. You can find the online Scratch editor at <a href="http://jumpto.cc/scratch-new" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/scratch-new</a>. It looks like this:

+ The cat sprite that you can see is the Scratch mascot. Let's get rid of it by right-clicking it and then clicking **delete**.

+ Next, click **Choose sprite from library** to open up a list of all the Scratch sprites.

+ Scroll down until you see a drum sprite. Click on a drum, and click **OK** to add it to your project.

+ Click the **shrink** icon, and then click on the drum a few times to make it smaller.

Give your program a name by typing one into the text box in the top left-hand corner.

You can then click **File** and then **Save now** to save your project. If you don't have a Scratch account, you can save a copy of your project by clicking **Download to your computer** instead.
